# MLA Architecture

The current version of the MLA is design to support a Mastery Assessement Pedagogy (MAP) style class
which meets the following criteria
* a student's course grade is determined by the number of course skills they master
* there is a weekly exam where each student has a personalized exam with one question for each skill that has been introduced but which they have not yet mastered.
* the exams are printed out on paper with one problem/skill per page. Students write their answers on the exam and upload a picture of each page to the app
* the students' answers are graded on a pass/fail basis where pass means they have demonstrated mastery of the skill

The MLA supports this pedadogy by offering the following features.

## Course Creation
* instructors (who are whitelisted by contacting tjhickey@brandeis.edu) can create a class in the MLA with a unique 7 digit PIN code for students to register
* students register for a course by using their gmail address and entering the 7 digit PIN for the class
* instructors can add Teaching Assistants to a class to help with the grading

## Skill Lists
* instructors create a list of skills for the course
* they can import the skills from an other course
* instructors can add or remove skills from their course

## Exams or Problem Sets
* instructors can create problem sets and make them visible or keep them hidden from the class
* each problem in the exam is designed to test mastery of a single skill 
* instructors can add problems to a problem set by creating a new problem testing a course skill or selecting one from all problems in the system for that skill

## Problems
* instructors can create problems in a problem set by giving it a name, description, rubric, and a set of skills (typically just one skill)
* instructors can import problems from another class by viewing all problems in the system that have that skill

## Grading
* instructors and TAs can review students answers to the problems in a problem set and descide if they jmastered the skill or not. They can also provide feedback.
* students can submit a regrade request if they believe the grading is incorrect

## Dashboards
* students can see which skills they have mastered and which they still need to master
* instructors can see mastery data for all students in the class
