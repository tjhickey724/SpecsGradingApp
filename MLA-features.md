# MLA Features

## Logging in
Every user must log in using google authentication to see any page in this app.
When they do they are sent to the mainindex page which has links to two page:
* MGA - the Math Grading App:   used for the Math 5a, 10a, 10b courses at Brandeis
* MLAp - the Mastery Learning App: used for any course that adopts the M.A.P approach to teaching

Once logged in you have access to a menubar at the top of the page which lets you
* return to Home
* logout
* view your Profile
* view the About and Stats pages

## MGA
We won't document this now because it is an interim feature and will be replaced by the next version of the MLA...

## MLA
The main MLA page allows you to do several things:
* join an MLA course using a 7 digit PIN
* view your courses (as a student, TA, or owner)
* create a new course (but this requires that you be white-listed by contacting the administrator running the site)
