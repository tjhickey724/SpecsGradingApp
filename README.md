# Mastery Learning App User's Guide
The Mastery Learning App has been designed to help faculty teach course using the 
Mastery Assessment Pedagogy (M.A.P.) approach presented in Dr. Ella Tuson's recent PhD Dissertation.

There can be variations to this approach, but this app is designed for a very particular style of pedagogy
which has four key components:
1. **Skills** The course has a clearly specified list of measureable learning objectives, which we call skills. The goal is for students to mastery all of the skills. The course grade is completely determined by the set of skills they student masters. Such lists typically have 30-50 skills
2. **Weekly Skill-based Exams** The students are given a written exam every week (or two) covering all of the skills introduced so far. There is one question per skill. The questions are designed to rigorously assess student mastery and are often perceived to be hard but fair. The pass rate on individual questions is typically around 50%, but the pass rate for skills, after being given multiple attempts to demonstrate mastery, is typically around 80-100%.
3. **Pass/Fail grading on skills** The student answers are graded pass/fail, where a pass means the student has clearly demonstrated mastery of the specified skill. After the exam, the student is given access to a fully worked out solution, and they may receive some minimal feedback about where they went wrong or how to study to pass this skill in the next exam. If a student demonstrates mastery on a skill by answering the question correctly, they will no longer be questioned on that skill. Thus each week the questions on the quiz will vary from student to student. Those students who have mastered all skills so far will only see the new skills introduced that week. Other students will have questions on skills they have previously attempted but not mastered.
4. **Personalized proctored exams on paper** The exams are given on paper, with one page per question, in a proctored exam. Each student has a personalized exam with their name on the title page and only those problems they have not yet mastered appear in their copy of the exam. Once they complete the exam they walk over to the "uploading" part of the room, take photos of their exam pages with their phone, and upload the photos to the cloud for grading.
